# Survey on Conversational AI

Conversational Bots have have a lot of importance now
it is difficult to get academic information/papers since much of the work stays at the industry

we can build a complete architecture but it might not be the most time-efficient solution

we need to survey current open-source technologies and state of the art methods of building such software.

some initial guesses:

For language parsing and grammar:

+ NLTK
+ Stanford Core NLP
+ Spacy

For ML:

+ Scikit learn
+ word2vec

Open-source bot frameworks

+ ChatterBot
